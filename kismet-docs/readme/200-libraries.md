## Integrated libraries

Kismet uses several libraries which are built as part of the Kismet source code; without the open-source community this wouldn't be possible.

* [fmtlib](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt): C++ string formatting for faster message generation with fewer temporary variables.
* [jsoncpp](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/): JSON parser
* [kaitai](https://kaitai.io): Binary parser generator and stream library
* [microhttpd](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/): Webserver
* [nlohmann json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json): JSON sanitization
* [sha1](https://github.com/vog/sha1): Simple SHA1 implementation
* [radiotap](http://radiotap.org): Radiotap header definitions
* [xxhash32](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash): Fast 32bit hashing algorithm
